# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to create dataframes based in two general databases from a district schools group. With the dataframes, once created, was possible to get the summary of details such as school size, school budget, score in the assingments of reading and math per school, and percetnage of students passing both assingments.

## Results
### Analysis Results
After to modify the dataframes, changing the scores of 9th graders in Thomas High School to a NaN value we can see the next callouts:

- District Results
There was a reduction in tenths with respect to the original results, however the reduction was so slightly that we could say the results weren't affected at all.

- School Summary Results
As well that in the district results, the school summary wasn't affected at all after taking out the 9th graders results of THS:

- THS results
At first the results of THS, counting the quantity of studens in 9th grade, was very low vs the original results:

However, after taking out the students quantity from the equation, the results for THS were so much better, affecting the final results just in tenths as in the district results:

- Scores by grades
The scores by grade weren't affected at all as well, just for the 9th graders in THS were replaced by the NaN statement

- Scores by spending
The scores by spending has just slightly reduction in the $630-644 range, in tenths, but we could say the results weren't affected at all as well.

- Scores by school size
The scores by spending has just slightly reduction in the Medium schools size, in tenths, but we could say the results weren't affected at all as well.

- Scores by school type
No changes at all

## Summary
The main changes were made at the code level, but after replacing the information of the 9th graders, we could tell that the results are still the same at a glance.
However we could see the changes in
    - District summary data frame,
    - School summary data frame,
    - Math and reading scores by grade, and
    - Scores by school spending
