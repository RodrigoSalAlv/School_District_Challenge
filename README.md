# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to create dataframes based in two general databases from a district schools group. With the dataframes, once created, was possible to get the summary of details such as school size, school budget, score in the assingments of reading and math per school, and percetnage of students passing both assingments.

## Results
### Analysis Results
After to modify the dataframes, changing the scores of 9th graders in Thomas High School to a NaN value we can see the next callouts:

- District Results
There was a reduction in tenths with respect to the original results, however the reduction was so slightly that we could say the results weren't affected at all.

- School Summary Results
As well that in the district results, the school summary wasn't affected at all after taking out the 9th graders results of THS:

- THS results
At first the results of THS, counting the quantity of studens in 9th grade, was very low vs the original results:

However, after taking out the students quantity from the equation, the results for THS were so much better, affecting the final results just in tenths as in the district results:
